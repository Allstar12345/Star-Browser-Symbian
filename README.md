# Star-Browser-Symbian



Hi everyone!

This is Star Browser for Symbian OS, the most popular Qt based browser for Symbian Anna/Belle devices, first released on 15 June 2013.


Please see Star-Browser-Download-Manager repo for the external Download manager, this can also be disabled if you wish (see that repo for details).


Coding stlye is mostly from 2013-2015 so please excuse the awful ways some things are implemented back in those days, I did clean it up a tad in the 2020 1.75 one off release but lots remains.

WebView is a subclass of qdeclarativewebview from the open source Qt Project, based on Qt 4.8.

SocialConnect folder is the old Twitter and Facebook plugins which are broken from TLS issues and old API's, but I've left them there in case someone wants to try fix them.

License wise, do what you please but any pubic clones of Star Browser must keep the About Page credits to myself and all other people on the list.


Special thanks over the years to:
